# 🍅 PomodoroTimer
A simple pomodoro timer in javascript created during my school time
## 📓 About it
This timer implement the [pomodoro method](https://www.methode-pomodoro.fr/).  

It was a school project for web development in javascript  
The pomodoro method work with two main phases one of 25 minutes work  
and another one 5 minute break.  
After 4 cycles you benefit from a break time of 20 minutes  
## ⚙️ How it works

* there is the countdown timer
* a simple display of the current mode that switch between work and pause
* an input to type how many minutes you want to work
* an other input to type how many break time you want
* and an other one to type how many break time you want for the big break
* a button to start the application
* an other button to reset the application

When you want to have other minutes than the    
default ones you must ***press enter***.
